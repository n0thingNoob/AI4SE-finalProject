    "reasoning": "Data shows TSLA is in a macro uptrend (Price ~$391 vs SMA100 ~$360) but experiencing short-term weakness (down ~10% recently). The Type C archetype capitalizes on this by using SMA(100) to confirm the primary bullish trend remains intact while using RSI < 40 to snipe the entry at oversold levels near support, avoiding the risk of catching a falling knife in a full reversal."
