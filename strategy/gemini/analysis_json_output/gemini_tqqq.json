      "key_observation": "The Nasdaq-100 is undergoing a sharp correction (tech rout) driven by 'sell-the-news' reaction to NVDA earnings, pushing TQQQ into deep oversold territory (RSI < 30) while still holding above key long-term support."

    "reasoning": "TQQQ is a 3x leveraged instrument, making it highly dangerous to trade against the primary trend. The 'Type C' strategy filters for a positive long-term trend (Price > SMA200) to ensure we aren't buying into a bear market crash, while the aggressive RSI < 35 entry captures the sharp, fear-driven capitulation dips typical of the current high-volatility regime."
