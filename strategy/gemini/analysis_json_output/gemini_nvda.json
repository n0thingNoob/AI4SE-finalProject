    "reasoning": "NVDA remains in a long-term uptrend (Price > SMA 100) driven by strong AI infrastructure demand (Blackwell chips). The current pullback post-earnings offers a mean-reversion entry point. We use RSI < 45 to identify the dip and SMA(100) to ensure we are trading with the primary trend."
