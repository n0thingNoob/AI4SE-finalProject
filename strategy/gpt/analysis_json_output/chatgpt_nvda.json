    "sentiment": "Bullish",
    "volatility_level": "High",
    "key_observation": "NVDA remains in a 12-month uptrend (roughly +30% TTM) but has pulled back ~15–20% from late-October 2025 highs after Nov-2025 earnings amid elevated option-implied volatility (~40%) and renewed “competition/custom-chip” narrative risk."

  "reasoning": "Over the past 12 months NVDA has still produced strong positive returns (uptrend regime), but the last ~2 weeks have featured a sharp post-earnings pullback and headline-driven swings (record results yet stock weakness tied to valuation/AI-competition and custom-chip fears), which is exactly the environment where pure trend-following often whipsaws while pure mean-reversion can fight the primary trend; a Hybrid (Trend + Dip) approach keeps exposure aligned with the dominant uptrend (Price>SMA100) and only buys when short-term momentum is washed out (RSI<45), with explicit risk controls sized for NVDA’s currently elevated volatility."
