  "reasoning": "TQQQ exhibits strong bullish momentum over the 12-month timeframe but experiences amplified volatility and frequent 5-15% pullbacks due to its 3x leveraged structure. The Hybrid strategy allows participation in the primary uptrend while avoiding buying at overextended levels. Using SMA(50) confirms the intermediate-term trend remains intact, while RSI(42) entry threshold accounts for TQQQ's tendency for deeper pullbacks than the underlying QQQ. The wider stop loss (8%) accommodates the ETF's inherent volatility while maintaining favorable risk-reward ratios."
